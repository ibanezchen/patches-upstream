Subject: [PATCH 23/37] sched: Relocated get_cpu_usage() and change return type

Move get_cpu_usage() to an earlier position in fair.c and change return
type to unsigned long as negative usage doesn't make much sense. All
other load and capacity related functions use unsigned long including
the caller of get_cpu_usage().

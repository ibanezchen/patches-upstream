Subject: [PATCH 60/62] arm: Enable max freq invariant scheduler load-tracking
 and capacity support

Maximum Frequency Invariance has to be part of Cpu Invariance because
Frequency Invariance deals only with differences in load-tracking
introduces by Dynamic Frequency Scaling and not with limiting the
possible range of cpu frequency.

By placing Maximum Frequency Invariance into Cpu Invariance,
load-tracking is scaled via arch_scale_cpu_capacity()
in __update_load_avg() and cpu capacity is scaled via
arch_scale_cpu_capacity() in update_cpu_capacity().

To be able to save the extra multiplication in the scheduler hotpath
(__update_load_avg()) we could:

 1 Inform cpufreq about base cpu capacity at boot and let it handle
   scale_cpu_capacity() as well.
 2 Use the cpufreq policy callback which would update a per-cpu current
   cpu_scale and this value would be return in scale_cpu_capacity().
 3 Use per-cpu current max_freq_scale and current cpu_scale with the
   current patch.
